I am an awesome full-stack web developer. I like ruby and javascript.
I like to spend my free time to research and learn a new and an alternative techonolgy.
I played with python and haskell, with meteor and jekyll;). I love my wife
and my two little daughters. Jesus is my Lord. And I dream about working in
big company such as github or heroku:)
