A lot of days ago I had problems with self-management. I tried a lot of tools. And now I have a wonderful workflow!

So for self-management for every days I'm using habitica! It's a great tool which turns planing of your dailies to a game. Checkout [it][habitica].

I'm using [apptrajectory][trajectory] as project management tool and [trello][trello] as canban tool.

To create plan for nearest tasks and project TODOs in job process I'm using plugin for my text editor. So if you use sublime text then checkout [it][sublime-todos];)
